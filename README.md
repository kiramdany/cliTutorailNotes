### [Click here to start the tutorial](Tutorial/Intro.md)

Basic introduction to fundamental uses of command line.

Written primarily with Mac in mind. Should make sense on other platforms but be aware there may be discrepancies.

**For students:**

Everything within the _`Try it out`_ sections should be run from the Terminal application and the previous sections lead on to the next.

## Usage

Idea of tutorial is for a teacher to take a group of students through the accompanying notes.

However, they can also be followed without.

Notes are fairly brief and to the point so if teachers want to fill in extra context there are some [additional teachers notes](TeachersNotes/README.md) for ideas.

You can view all the notes within GitHub itself or download a local copy and use a markdown reader. I like [json-viewer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-viewer/gbmdgpbipfallnflgajpaliibnhdgobh).
