## Useful Tips

-   `.` represents the current directory
-   `clear` ( moves the cursor down to clear screen )
-   cmd + k ( removes all previous terminal output )

<br>

-   cmd + t ( new tab )
-   cmd + n ( new window )
-   cmd + w ( close window )

<br>

-   ctrl + tab ( next tab )
-   ctrl + shift + tab ( previous tab )
-   cmd + ~ ( next window )
-   cmd + shift + ~ ( previous window )

## Open

-   `open .` ( use this when you're stuck )
-   `open folder` ( similar to above )

`open` command opens file with the default application for its type
( default application can be set using Finder )

-   `open file.txt` ( Text Edit )
-   `open index.html` ( Some browser - I think )
-   `open http://some.url` ( Some browser )
-   `open directory` ( Finder )

## Application launchers

Some applications allow you to create command line launchers, some install them automatically

-   brackets file/folder ( brackets )
-   idea file/folder ( intelli J )
-   subl ( sublime )
-   atom ( atom )
-   code (visual studio code)
-   mate ( textmate )
-   stree ( sourcetree )

These allow you to open file/folder with the corresponding application

E.g

-   `stree` - will launch/switch to sourcetree application
-   `atom .` - will open current folder in atom text editor

Can test whether you already have them with

-   `type` {command} - command being `atom` or `stree` for example

## ctrl + c

Cancel running task

E.g

-   `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080` - Creates a simple webserver to serve files in current directory
-   cmd + t - Open new tab
-   `open http://localhost:8080` - Navigate to directory in browser
-   ctl + c in previous tab to stop the server (might need to do this more than once)
